CHANGE LIST
-----------
Changes from 6.0.8112.100 to 6.0.8112.200:

Change in compiler to mitigate vulnerabilities related to Spectre and Meltdown.

Changes from 6.0.7728.100 to 6.0.8112.100:

Fixed issue where LOGIN7 packet did not contain the drivers version number.

Changes from 6.0.7507.100 to 6.0.7728.100:

Fixed an issue in sqljdbc_xa.dll where transactions may cause handle leak to occur in SQL Server.

Changes from 4.2 to 6.0:

New Feature: Always Encrypted - Application developers can now utilize the Always Encrypted (AE) feature that is 
available since SQL Server 2016 CTP (or higher). The JDBC driver enables Always Encrypted feature by transparently 
encrypting and decrypting sensitive data stored in encrypted database columns in the SQL Server. For more information 
see the MSDN documentation on using Always Encrypted with JDBC driver. 

New Feature: Internationalized Domain Name - The JDBC driver now supports Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) for 
server and instance names. For more information see MSDN documentation on using IDN with JDBC driver.

New Feature: Table-Valued Parameters - Table-valued parameters provide an easy way to marshal multiple rows of data from 
a client application to SQL Server without requiring multiple round trips or special server-side logic for processing the data. 
You can use table-valued parameters to encapsulate rows of data in a client application and send the data to the server in a 
single parameterized command. For more information see MSDN documentation on Table-Valued parameters.

New Feature: Azure Active Directory (AAD) - AAD authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Azure SQL Database v12 using 
identities in AAD. Use AAD authentication to centrally manage identities of database users and as an alternative to SQL 
Server authentication. The JDBC Driver 6.0 allows you to specify your AAD credentials in the JDBC connection string 
to connect to Azure SQL DB. For more information see MSDN documentation on Setting the Connection Properties for the JDBC driver.

Improvement: AlwaysOn Availability Groups (AG) - The driver now supports transparent connections to AlwaysOn Availability 
Groups. The driver quickly discovers the current AlwaysOn topology of your server infrastructure and connects to the 
current active server transparently. For more information see MSDN documentation on Setting the Connection Properties for 
the JDBC driver.

Improvement: The JDBC driver can now support retrieving parameter metadata with prepared statements for complex queries 
such as subqueries/joins. Note that this improvement is available only when using SQL Server 2012 and newer versions.


------------
KNOWN ISSUES
------------
The following are known issues with the Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server:

1) PARAMETER METADATA LIMITATIONS WHEN USING SQL SERVER 2008 OR 2008 R2

1.a) PreparedStatement.getParameterMetadata() throws an SQLException when used
with a parametrized MERGE query
1.b) Parameter metadata for prepared statements does not work with queries having subqueries/joins.


2) JavaKerberos and IBM VMs

If you are running under Windows environments you may have to specify the principalname in the 
configuration file to get the Java Kerberos working. For example: 
SQLJDBCDriver {
  com.ibm.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  seDefaultCcache=true
  credsType=initiator
  principal=principalname@principaldomain;
};


3) CONNECTION DROPPING WITH SQL AZURE

When connecting to SQL Azure, idle connections may be terminated by a network component (such as a 
firewall) after a period of inactivity. To avoid dropping idle connections by a network component, 
the following registry settings (or their non-Windows equivalents) should be set on the operating 
system where the driver is loaded:
           
Registry Setting                                                                   Recommended value
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveTime            30000
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\KeepAliveInterval         1000
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\TcpMaxDataRetransmission  10
